                    Ladies and gentlemen, history keeps repeating itself but doesn't
                    teach us any lessons. 'Never again' has turned into 'again and
                    again and again.' So today, ladies and gentlemen, take Hotel
                    Lunar as a wake-up call and a message to be our messenger that
                    people are the ones who can change what they want to change.
                </p>
